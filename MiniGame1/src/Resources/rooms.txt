Upstairs Bedroom
false
You open up the bedroom door to see a complete mess. The lamp is on when your daughter has been gone all weekend. It looks like someone has broken in. Clothes are scattered all around, every drawer is open, pictures and paintings are all crooked. You scan the room and are startled by the blood red "SOON" written on the wall. You feel yourself start to tense as you look back down the hall EAST towards your bedroom. For a second you thinking you hear a faint scream come from DOWN the stairs.
